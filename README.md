Task:

1.	Fork this repository into your own GitHub repository. This will be referred to as the 'UI Project'.
2.	Implement a Web API 2 project which can be consumed by the UI project.
3.	Secure the UI and Web API projects using Auth0.
4.	Implement a controller in the Web API 2 project which exposes CRUD for an object called ‘Incident’ (hint: example incidents can be found on our website).
5.	Consume your controller actions from the angular UI.
6.	Ensure these projects are in a repository on GitHub which is accessible by NSWRFS (e.g. public or add us to a private repo) and either:
	
	* submit a pull request to us.
	* email us the repository details.

For bonus points:

1.	Deploy the project to AppHarbor.
2.	Persist the data to a database at MongoHQ.
